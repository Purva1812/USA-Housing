# 🏠 USA Housing Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in the USA using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to analyze key factors such as income, house age, number of rooms, and population to build an accurate regression model.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Housing prices depend on multiple variables. This project aims to:

* Analyze housing dataset
* Perform data cleaning & visualization
* Apply ML algorithms
* Predict house prices with high accuracy

---

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following features:

* `Avg. Area Income` – Average income of residents
* `Avg. Area House Age` – Average house age
* `Avg. Area Number of Rooms`
* `Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms`
* `Area Population`
* `Price` – Target variable (House price)
* `Address` – Dropped (not useful for prediction)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

---

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing

* Checked missing values
* Dropped unnecessary column (`Address`)
* Feature selection
* Train-test split

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Correlation heatmap
* Distribution plots
* Pair plots
* Insights on feature relationships

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

### 1️⃣ Linear Regression

* Best suited for continuous target prediction
* Achieved high accuracy

### 2️⃣ Decision Tree Regressor

* Captures non-linear relationships

### 3️⃣ Random Forest Regressor

* Improved accuracy using ensemble learning

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R² Score

---

## 📉 Sample Output

```
Linear Regression R² Score: 0.91
Random Forest R² Score: 0.88
Decision Tree R² Score: 0.74
```
